    How to configure
--------------------------

[Server]

server.port = sets the port on which the server waits for connections
server.number_of_threads = sets the number of threads the server uses for processing requests
server.update_interval = sets the interval (in ms) between two consecutive "Update Clients" phases 
server.stats_interval = sets the interval (in ms) between two consecutive stats outputs to the stats.out file
                      = due to its format stats.out should be viewed using a spreadsheet application

[Workload]
/* Used only when running a synthetic workload */
/* To toggle on/off the synthetic workload, uncomment/comment line 10 in server_cl.h */
workload.cycles = number of cycles to run for each server thread
workload.client_count = total number of clients
workload.max_num_actions = maximum number of actions per client per cycle
/* Each server thread runs for a number of cycles, 
   in each cycle, for each assigned client, it performs a 
   random number (between [0, max_num_actions]) of randomly selected actions  */

[Quest]

server.quest_between = sets the interval (in ms) between two consecutive quests
server.quest_length = sets the duration (in ms) of a quest

[Client]

client.disconnect_timeout = sets the amount of time the clients waits for a message from the server before it disconnects
client.think_time = sets the interval (in ms) between two consecutive actions taken by a client
client.render_delay = sets the minumum time that needs to pass between the rendering of two consecutive frames

[Map]

map.size_x = the size of the map along the x coordinate
map.size_y = the size of the map along the y coordinate
map.tree_depth = the depth of the area node tree
map.balance_type = the type of load balancing
/* To toggle on/off the load balancing, uncomment/comment line 13 in server_cl.h */

[Entity Types]

n_entity_types = no of entity types used in the game

entity_type[i].name = the name of this entity type
entity_type[i].ratio = the percentage out of the map area that can be filled with entities of this type
entity_type[i].fixed = flag saying whether entities of this type can move around the map
entity_type[i].n_attr = the number of attributes that this entity type has

entity_type[i].attribute_type[j].name = the name of this attribute type
entity_type[i].attribute_type[j].min = the minimum value that this attribute can have
entity_type[i].attribute_type[j].max = the maximum value that this attribute can have


[Actions]

n_actions = no of actions

action[i].name = the name of this action
action_range[i].front = the range of this action in front of the player
action_range[0].behind = the range of this action behind the player
action_range[0].left = the range of this action to the left of the player
action_range[0].right = the range of this action to the right of the player
